# PharmaCare
PharmaCare is a project developed by us which helps to locate medicines available in nearby medical stores. In case the medicine is not available the system suggests an alternative & generic medicine to it.
# Working:
Our system has a registration page where the store owner has to register & his details are stored in our database. When the user uses our system we take his location and apply the haversine formula to find the medicine searched by him within 5km radius, if it is not available then the radius is increased upto 15km.
